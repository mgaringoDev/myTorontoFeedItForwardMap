From their website:

Feed it Forward is a Canadian not-for-profit with two main goals: to feed Canadians that are food insecure, and to reduce food waste. Our mission is to make a difference in the lives of fellow Canadians who are in need of assistance with securing nutritious food and regular balanced meals.

Basically the tasks are as follows:

1. As you slide it up, the map will show the areas we are now serving in the GTA and as you continue it will show how our distribution can (with funding) grow across the GTA

2. It would also show (at the same time) the metrics as shown in the attached email

The model will be based on a break-even analysis (we are a nonprofit) and show our funding requirements necessary to ramp up and carry on the business.
